Eriksson defended players' rights to talk to other clubs following allegations that Arsenal's Ashley Cole had a secret meeting with Chelsea. But a Premier League spokesman said the rules are very clear on the subject. He said: "A professional footballer under contract doesn't have the right to speak to another club without the permission of his current employer." The spokesman added: "The Premier League rules are clear on that. There is an ongoing inquiry into this matter and if it is proven that the rules have been broken then the guilty parties are liable to be punished."

The Premier League is set to investigate whether Chelsea held a secret meeting with the Arsenal defender last month. Eriksson earlier said he was unconcerned if reports that Chelsea made an illegal approach prove to be true. He said: "As a professional footballer it must be your right to listen if some other work is available. "We don't live in a dictatorship, we're in a democracy. It's the same in other professions but normally no problem."
