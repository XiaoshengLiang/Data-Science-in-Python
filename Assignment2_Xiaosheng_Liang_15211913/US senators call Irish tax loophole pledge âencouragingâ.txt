US senators call Irish tax loophole pledge âencouragingâ





Two US senators who have sharply criticised Irelandâs loose tax laws for allowing American multinationals to avoid taxes have described the Governmentâs promise to close a loophole as âencouraging.â

The Government plans to introduce a change that will force Irish companies to declare tax residency in a different jurisdiction or else be held liable for the Irish corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent in 2015.It is in Irelandâs interests to stop blocking a tax on financial transactionsApple was criticised by the two senators at a Congressional hearing in May for using Irish companies, which were not tax resident anywhere, to pay less than 2 per cent tax on $44 billion of non-US income over four years.âIrelandâs promise to reform its tax rules to stop multinationals from using Irish subsidiaries to escape or defer paying taxes anywhere in the world is encouraging,â the senators said in a joint statement released last night in response to Mr Noonanâs comments.âImportant questions do remain, however, including whether the new rules will continue to allow Irish subsidiaries to dodge taxes by, for example, excluding substantial income from the 12 per cent Irish tax rate, calculating taxable income in ways that produce a lower effective tax rate, or simply declaring tax residency with no corporate tax.



The Government has drawn fire from tax campaigners over companies such as Apple, Facebook and Google using Irish companies to exploit international tax loopholes to avoid multi-billion dollar tax bills.The Ministerâs announcement marks the first move to crack down on tax avoidance by multinationals, yielding to pressure to rein in sharp global tax practices followed by major corporations.

Mr Noonan said that countries are competing more and more aggressively for âmobile foreign direct investmentâ and he wanted to ensure Irelandâs corporate tax regime remains competitive.



The chamberâs chairwoman Anna Scally said the release of a document outlining Irelandâs international tax strategy as part of the budget would provide certainty, and would be âwelcomed by potential and current investorsâ.âThis strategy reconfirms Irelandâs long term commitment to attracting foreign direct investment to create jobs and economic activity. Irelandâs corporate tax regime is open and transparent and the Irish Government has reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining a competitive corporate tax regime,â she said.
