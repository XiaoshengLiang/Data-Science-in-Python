The ESRI is clearly fearful the Government may miss its fiscal targets for next year. If so, those austerity measures now deferred would instead have to be introduced in next yearâs budget. That would damage hopes of a sustained economic recovery, and weaken national morale. Much, however, depends on whether the Government achieves its growth forecasts for 2014.Despite its reservations about the Governmentâs proposed fiscal adjustment, the ESRI nevertheless presents an optimistic assessment of Irelandâs economic prospects, noting some encouraging signs of recovery. Rising employment and falling unemployment are seen as the âclearest signalâ of the economyâs slow rebound. Where the institute forecasts an unemployment rate of 13 per cent in 2014, the Department of Finance estimate is for a slightly lower number. Either way, the trend is positive and marks a steady decline from the 14.7 per cent peak figure in 2012. Lower unemployment means a reduction in the social welfare bill, while rising employment boosts tax revenues. And as consumers start to spend more, greater signs of public confidence in economic recovery are increasingly evident.
