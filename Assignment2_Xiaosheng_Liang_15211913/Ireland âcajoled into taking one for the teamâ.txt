Ireland âcajoled  into taking one for the teamâWillem Buiter, global chief economist with Citigroup: âThey [Ireland] have been given a bit . . . but it doesnât add up to the extra burden put on the Irish taxpayerâChristopher McKinley

Ireland has an âexceptional claimâ to have its banks recapitalised by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the euro-zone bailout fund, according to Citigroup chief economist Willem Buiter .





âThey [Ireland] have been given a bit . . . but it doesnât add up to the extra burden put on the Irish taxpayer,â he said.Last week German finance minister Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble reiterated the countryâs opposition to using the ESM to recapitalise Irish banks directly.

He said that when somebody offers you a âvirtually free option which gives you free insuranceâ it would take a brave person to turn it down.âBelt and braces are better than braces alone,â he said. âIreland would be well advised to take the insurance of a light precautionary standby programme.âComments are closed for this article.
