New EU rules allow in-depth review of member states  to identify imbalances



The battle over Berlinâs record trade surplus moved up a gear today as the European Commission decided to prepare an in-depth analysis of Germanyâs persistently high current account surplus to find out if it is a sign of a serious imbalance in Europeâs biggest economy.New EU rules, demanded by Berlin and others as a response to the euro crisis allow Brussels to launch in-depth review of any member state flagged as showing competitiveness problems or macroeconomic imbalances.Germany now faces a so-called macroeconomic imbalance procedure, in which the commission probes economic data and can even demand action where the current account surplus exceeds 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) over three years. Failure to implement commission recommendations could end with the commission imposing a fine of 0.1 per cent of GDP.The EU will recommend steps to fix the problem if the review, due to be finished early next year, finds the surplus is harmful.

High-wire actLaunching an investigation into Europeâs largest member state could prove a high-wire act for the Brussels executive, plunging it into a highly-politicised economic blame game for the euro-zone crisis.

Berlin consistently dismisses these criticisms, saying it should not be punished for the competitiveness of its globalised exporters.Of late Berlin has adopted a more differentiated tone: acknowledging imbalances in the past while insisting that Germanyâs biggestÂ export growth markets are now outside Europe . German exports to the euro zone dropped from 4.4 per cent in 2007 to 2.2 per cent last year.

The long-simmering row over Germanyâs excess of exports over imports burst into the open last week when the US accusedÂ Germany of pursuing economic profit at the expense of its euro-area partners.Record trade surplusEconomic data released last week added to the debate, showingÂ Germanyâs trade surplus hit a new record in September. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus widened to â¬18.8 billion in September while the current account surplus was up 8 per cent year-on-year to â¬19.7 billion â well above the 6 per cent threshold considered excessive in the EU.Mr Rehn pointed out yesterday that Germanyâs export surplus has exceeded 6 per cent every year since 2007.Berlin is expected to launch an energetic defence, pointing to rising domestic demand and a recent IMF analysis arguing that its trade surplus, forecast to drop below 6 per cent next year, is not the result of political failings in Berlin.Return to results
