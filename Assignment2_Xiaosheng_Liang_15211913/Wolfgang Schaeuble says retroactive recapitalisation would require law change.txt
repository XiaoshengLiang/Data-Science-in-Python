German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has reiterated German opposition to using the ESM fund to directly recapitalise Irish banks, saying that the current ESM treaty does not allow for retroactive action, and adding that the process would require a change in German legislation.

Ireland has been hopeful of securing direct recapitalisation of its banks from the euro zoneâs permanent rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) . The â¬500 billion fund has â¬60 billion earmarked for direct bank recapitalisation, and in June euro zone finance ministers agreed in principle to consider requests for retroactive application of the instrument on a âcase by case basis.â

Irelandâs plea for further debt relief for its banks has emerged as a discussion point in German coalition negotiations. The left of centre Social Democrats party has argued that future decisions on Irelandâs financial situation would take into account its corporate tax rate and resistance to the Financial Transactions Tax (FTT), a tax on certain financial transactions such as bonds and derivatives that has been backed by 11 member states. It argues that future bank bailouts should be funded by the FTT.As Angela Merkelâs Christian Democrats prepare for a further round of coalition discussions with the SPD, one possible outcome of a new government formation is that the SPD could assume responsibility for the finance ministry, as was the case in the last CDU-SPD coalition.



Speaking after the euro group meeting in Luxembourg yesterday evening, EU Commissioner Olli Rehn declined to speculate on the outcome of the tests, but said the Commission was working closely with the Irish Central Bank on the review.With discussions set to intensify between the Government and the troika following todayâs budget, the balance sheet assessments of Bank of Ireland, AIB and Permanent TSB are the main remaining milestone for the State as it seeks to exit its three-year bailout in December.
