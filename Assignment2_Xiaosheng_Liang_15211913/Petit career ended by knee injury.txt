Petit career ended by knee injury

Former France midfielder Emmanuel Petit has ended his playing career after failing to recover from knee surgery.

The 34-year-old ex-Arsenal and Chelsea star made the decision before Christmas after realising he would never regain full fitness. He told French newspaper L'Equipe: "I knew straight away it was over. Twenty years of your life come to a stop. It's like a small death." Petit had not played since being released by Chelsea last summer. A key member of the France side that won the 1998 World Cup, Petit scored the last goal in their 3-0 victory over Brazil in the final. He won the French League title with Monaco in 1997, and the Premiership and FA Cup double with Arsenal in 1998.
