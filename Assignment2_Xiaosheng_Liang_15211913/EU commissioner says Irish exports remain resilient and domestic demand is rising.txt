EU commissioner says Irish exports remain resilient and domestic demand is rising





Speaking at a Eurogroup press conference in Luxembourg this morning, Mr Rehn said the financial support provided to both countries by the EU-IMF had âhelped to deliver an economic turnaroundâ.

âExports have remained resilient and there are signs that domestic demand is picking up.âHe said unemployment levels in both countries had begun to fall, but still remain âmuch too highâ.

âWithout prejudging the outcome of these exercises, we can say that both countries have a very good chance of successfully concluding their programmes in a sustainable manner,â he said.
