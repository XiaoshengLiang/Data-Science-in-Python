Minister for Finance Michael Noonan held his final meeting with senior figures from the EU and IMF yesterday in the Netherlands







Hour-long meetingBoth finance ministers described the hour-long meeting at the Dutch finance ministry as âconstructive.â While Mr Noonan said yesterday evening the decision on an exit strategy remained âfinely balancedâ.Unlike three years ago, at the time of the Irish bailout when contagion across peripheral countries was a primary concern, the decoupling of Irish government bond yields from the yields of other programme countries such as Greece and Portugal over the last year is assuaging concerns about contagion should Irelandâs return to full private funding spark market unrest.The fact that a request to draw down a precautionary credit line from the euro zone rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), would need parliamentary approval from a number of countries, including Germany , is also weighing on the decision.





Sentiment in Washington

With the final troika visit to Dublin due to finish tomorrow, Mr Noonan may make a decision before next Thursdayâs meeting of all 17 euro zone finance ministers, in Brussels. Any decision on a precautionary credit line will be first brought to Cabinet in Dublin before being discussed by the euro group of finance ministers.
