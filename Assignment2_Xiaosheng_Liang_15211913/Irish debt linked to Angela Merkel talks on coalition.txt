Irelandâs corporate tax regime and the Governmentâs claim for further bank aid from Europe has been sucked into talks on the formation of the next German government.In discussions with German chancellor Angela Merkel , the opposition Social Democratic party has set its face against using the ESM permanent bailout fund to provide capital directly to Irish banks.The SPD is further reported to be seeking âfar-reaching commitments from Dublinâ on tax issues in return for any emergency loan facility from the ESM, a kind of overdraft to be used if investor confidence is suddenly lost.

âBinding preconditionâHaving won last monthâs election, the chancellorâs Christian Democratic party is now in coalition talks with the second-placed SPD because she lacks a parliamentary majority. The protection of taxpayers from costly bank bailouts is being described as a âbinding preconditionâ for the SPD in these talks.As the negotiation continues, the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung reported yesterday that the SPD sees no circumstances in which it would support direct ESM aid to Irelandâs banks.SPD finance spokesman Carsten Schneider was quoted saying such a programme would be possible only if Dublin granted two concessions on business taxation.Tax plansIreland would be obliged first to drop its opposition to a stalled European plan to tax financial transactions.Ireland would also be obliged to increase the 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate, something the Coalition has vowed not to do. There was no comment last evening from the spokesman for the Government, which expects a smooth exit from the EU/IMF bailout in December.

An Irish source said the Government would never comment on reports on coalition talks in any other country. It is understood, however, that the Government sees no erosion of Dr Merkelâs pledge one year ago to treat Irelandâs banking problem as a âspecial caseâ.Comments are closed for this article.
