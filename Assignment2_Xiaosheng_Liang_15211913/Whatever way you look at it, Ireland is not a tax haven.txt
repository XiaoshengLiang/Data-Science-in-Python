And so it begins again. An information request from the EU to three countries seeking further details about their tax systems â which is a regular feature of EU interaction with member states â triggers a slew of stories and commentary about âtax dealsâ, âtax havensâ and a broad denigration of the Irish tax system. Frankly, itâs sloppy, misleading and downright incorrect.

Transfer pricing rulesWhat can be said with absolute certainty is that every company within the charge to Irish tax pays tax at 12.5 per cent on their activities â that is a fact. In addition, since 2010 we also have OECD standard transfer pricing rules, which give Revenue the power to ensure that the profits reported by a company are commensurate with the risks, functions and activities of the Irish entity.There is no doubt that in the current global tax debate the concept of having an Irish incorporated entity, albeit one with no Irish connections, being outside the charge to Irish tax, looks incongruous.
