Nike defends under-fire football

Nike has defended its Premiership ball, after it was blamed for a spate of goalkeeping errors.





But Charlesworth says the ball - which is also used in the Spanish top-flight - is one of the most accurate on the market. He added: "At the beginning of the season the ball was presented to every manager and as many players as we could reach. The majority have been very happy to use it. "The ball has been designed with three things in mind - making it faster, more accurate and more visible - and all of that in order to bring more excitement to the game. "It's truer, we've tried to make it as round as possible. With old balls the technology didn't allow you to do what you can do now. "You might have had weight over to one side, you might have seaming, the bladder might have not sat in the right way so you could hit one half of the ball and it would do crazy things in the air. "The idea here is we've created everything perfectly even across the circumference of the ball. "It may be that skilled players are able to create things they intended to do easier. "This is where it's getting difficult because people are saying it moved in the air. "It's not the fault of the ball, it's how the player has kicked the ball, to make it move in the air because it's a truer ball and it allows you to do that. "It might be that they are intending that. It certainly doesn't move around like a remote control bumble bee or something. It goes the way it is kicked."Return to results
