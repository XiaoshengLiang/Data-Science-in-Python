Ireland will continue to campaign for retrospective direct recapitalisation of its banks by the ESM fund despite continuing German opposition to the move, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said yesterday.In a subtle but significant change of reasoning, Mr Noonan told RTÃ radio that the Government would be negotiating on all fronts for debt relief.âWe [are] still in a position to negotiate support from Europe so our debt can move down towards the European average,â the Minister said.



Special case

This  June, euro zone finance ministers agreed to examine the issue of âretroactiveâ deployment of the ESMâs direct recapitalisation instrument on a case-by-case basis.

Mr  Noonan said he was not concerned by Mr SchÃ¤uble âs comments.âI actually felt he left the door open,â he said. While the door had allegedly been closed on a promissory note deal and an extension of Irelandâs bailout loans, both had been achieved, he said.Coalition discussionsHe also stressed that the German finance ministerâs comments should be viewed in the context of ongoing coalition discussions in Germany, which has seen the Social Democrats Party take a tough line against Irelandâs claims for further debt relief.While Dublin is preparing for negotiations with its international lenders in the coming weeks on a strategy to exit the bailout, any decision on ESM direct recapitalisation is still a year away.Direct recapitalisation will only be possible once the Single Supervisory Mechanism is established. With European finance ministers having given the final go-ahead to the SSM on Tuesday, the mechanism will come into force in about a yearâs time.Germany hardened its stance against a common resolution fund for the euro zone at a finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg this week, reiterating its preference for a network of national supervisors, and raising questions about the rate of progress on banking union.Return to results
