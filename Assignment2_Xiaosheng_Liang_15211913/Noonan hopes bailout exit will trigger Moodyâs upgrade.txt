Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said he hopes Moodyâs rating agency will raise the Irelandâs credit rating from non-investment grade as the country exits its bailout program and plans debt sales.âWeâre hopeful that Moodyâs will have another look at us early in the New Year,â Mr Noonan said in an interview with Online News Television in London.âThe mood from all the rating agencies is positive at present.â





The yield on Irelandâs 10-year bonds was little changed at 3.56 per cent today, leaving the yield difference, or spread, over similar-maturity German bunds at 1.70 percentage points.âWe decided to exit the bailout and do it cleanly without any precautionary programs or any dedicated credit lines. Weâre not jumping out of the plane without a parachute. We have cash buffers in excess of â¬20 billion. That funds up to the second quarter of 2015 if we never entered the market.â

âA lot of people want to buy our paper. Weâre not junk, weâre doing fine,â he said.He also said there is no evidence that the countryâs lenders need more capital.Mr Noonan indicated heâll âtake time and seeâ what to do with the Stateâs 99.9 per cent stake in Allied Irish Bank, which is probably worth between â¬5 billion and â¬7 billion.He said he was still âhopefulâ on the Governmentâs campaign to win retroactive recapitalisation of the banking system.Online NewsComments are closed for this article.
