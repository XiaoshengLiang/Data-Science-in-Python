The first national audit into the death of babies in the weeks before or after birth shows that perinatal mortality rates here compare very favourably with UK and European figures.The perinatal mortality rate for 2011 was 6.1 per 1,000 births and rates have continued to decrease since then.Perinatal mortality is regarded as an important indicator of the quality of obstetric and neonatal care. It refers to the death of babies in the weeks before or after birth including stillbirths â babies born with no signs of life after 24 weeks of pregnancy or weighing at least 500g â and the deaths of babies within 28 days of being born.

National auditThe national audit, which is being launched today, was carried out by the NPEC based in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at University College Cork , in collaboration with the medical and midwifery staff from the 20 individual maternity units around the State.A total of 491 perinatal deaths in 2011 were recorded, arising from 74,265 births of at least 24 weeks gestation or at least 500g in birthweight.Stillbirths, deaths within the first seven days of life (early neonatal deaths) and deaths within the first eight to 28 days of life (late neonatal deaths) accounted for 318 (65 per cent), 138 (28 per cent) and 35 (7 per cent) of the 491 deaths respectively.Major congenital anomaly was the most common cause of death accounting for 26 per cent of stillbirths, 51 per cent of deaths within seven days and 57 of deaths in the 8-28 day range.
