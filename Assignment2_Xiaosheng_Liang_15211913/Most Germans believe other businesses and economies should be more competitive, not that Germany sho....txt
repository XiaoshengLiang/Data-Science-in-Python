Press conferences of Germanyâs economic advisory council are usually a sober affair. The groupâs official German name, the SachverstÃ¤ndigenrat, is such a multi-syllable mouthful that theyâre known unofficially as the five wise men â even if one of the men is now a woman.Their seasonal Berlin appearances involve the five economists handing over a doorstopper report to chancellor Angela Merkel, 502 pages, this week. They exchange a few pleasantries and then hold a press conference where they try to out-do each other with dry, airless analysis.Not this time. Before the eyes of the delighted Berlin press pack on Wednesday, the five wise men turned into the five bickering men â and woman. The row reached a peak when they were asked about the announcement of a European Commission investigation into whether Germanyâs trade surplus breaches the EU stability rulebook.



The latest round in this debate was triggered by the US treasury report last month criticising Germanyâs over-reliance on exports, its high current-account surplus and weak domestic demand.Combined, these factors âhave hampered rebalancing at a time when many other euro-area countries have been under severe pressureâ, the report concluded, with an eye on budget consolidation in the euro zone periphery. âThe net result has been a deflationary bias for the euro area, as well as for the world economy.âA whoâs who of international voices has, since then, backed the US: the French president, the Italian prime minister and the president of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde , among others.In 2010, as French finance minister, Lagarde argued that Berlinâs export-driven boom and much-vaunted trade surplus were built on low labour costs that was costing its neighbours dear. As well as imposing deficit limits, surplus countries had a role to play in the currency blocâs recovery by driving domestic demand, she said, noting that it âtakes two to tangoâ.Prompt and bluntThe German reaction, as always, is prompt and blunt. The economics ministry said the surplus was âa sign of the competitiveness of the German economy and global demand for quality products from Germanyâ.

âTo urge Real Madrid to side-line Cristiano Ronaldo would not help Malaga win the European Champions League,â wrote Prof Thomas Straubhaar , economist with Hamburgâs HWWI economist institute, in Die Welt newspaper.âIt would weaken the Spanish soccer league as a whole and would give the teams from other countries a better chance to win the tournament.â

Existing instruments for public debt levels were supplemented with a tool to monitor excessive surpluses. The argument for this was that surpluses can also have a damaging and distorting effect on a currency bloc.
