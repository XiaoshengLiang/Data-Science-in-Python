Germany economists warn on ESM bank recapitalisation

The European Central Bank in Frankfurt.  German economists said only limited direct ESM recapitalisations should be allowed when a euro zone banking union is established.

Leading German economists have described as âproblematicâ last yearâs June EU summit conclusions allowing direct recapitalisations of euro zone banks by the ESM bailout fund.

However the economists said only limited direct ESM recapitalisations should be allowed when a euro zone banking union is established, comprising joint regulation and oversight structures. Before then, a solution must be found for euro zone banksâ existing liabilities â so-called legacy debt  which does not drain the bailout fund.âLegacy cases should be solved at the outset through the participation of owners and creditors with resulting restructuring costs nationalised,â wrote the four economic institutes. âShould respective states be overwhelmed, these could be supported by the ESM.âThey issued a warning for Berlin to resist pressure from other euro zone member states to rush into activating the banking union.âThere is at present a danger that, given the pressing legacy liabilities in some member states, progress will not be made with the necessary thoroughness,â wrote the economists from four institutes: Munichâs Ifo, Berlinâs DIW, the IWH in Halle and Essenâs RWI.

âHowever continued high public and private debt levels, as well as existing risks in the banking sector, mean the vulnerability to domestic and external shocks remains high,â it added.Debt deal
