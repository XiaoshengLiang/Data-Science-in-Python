Authorities are investigating claims about UK ad sales booked through IrelandIrelandâs âDouble Irishâ tax structure, which has helped multinationals reduce their tax liabilities, is likely to become redundant says tax expert.

The UK tax authority has indicated it is investigating Google over its tax affairs following evidence from a whistleblower who claims British taxpayers are being âcheatedâ by the company.

He told the PAC: âI acknowledge that you did refer the whistleblower to us and I believe he did confirm to the press that we met him and we took his evidence from him and that we paid a great deal of interest to what he had to tell us and that is what we do with anyone who provides evidence. We take it very seriously and we always act upon it if it indicates non compliance by a taxpayer.â
