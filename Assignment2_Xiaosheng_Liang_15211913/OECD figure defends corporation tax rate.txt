Mr Noonan was speaking at the Irish Tax Institute/ Harvard Kennedy School global tax policy conference last night at Dublin Castle.He said the changes were aimed at eliminating the âmismatch that can exist between tax treaty partners so that in certain circumstances a company can end up being stateless in terms of their place of tax residencyâ.The Minister said âmultilateral action from many countries working together in common purposeâ was needed to put an end to this practice.

âI believe making this change now will provide global investors with clarity and confidence in our commitment to protect Irelandâs international standing and reputation,â he added.Meanwhile, a leading figure on international taxation policy has defended Irelandâs right to set its own corporation tax rate and said the country does not operate an opaque system.Matter of sovereigntyPascal Saint-Amans, director of the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), said the 12.5 per cent rate was a matter of the countryâs sovereignty.Mr Saint-Amans welcomed the Governmentâs recent publication outlining Irelandâs international tax strategy.





âIreland has always been keen on transparency; there is no such thing as an opaque system in Ireland.âEarlier this year the OECD reported to the G20 on the issue of base erosion and profit shifting, the legacy of which has been manifest in controversies involving multinationals paying little in tax despite reaping considerable profits.âSocial contractâOECD policy is directed toward the elimination of both double taxation and double non-taxation, arising out of companies basing themselves across jurisdictions and ultimately taking advantage of a complex web of tax laws.âI think the Irish people have made it clear that they are a sovereign people and 12.5 per cent is part of that social contract and itâs part of your sovereignty,â he said.
